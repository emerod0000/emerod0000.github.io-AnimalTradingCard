				<p>A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1 to 3 lb (0.45 to 1.36 kg), while larger ones can weigh up to 15 to 23 lb (6.8 to 10.4 kg). All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth. A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older.
				Puppies begin to nurse almost immediately. If the litter exceeds six puppies, particularly if one or more are obvious runts, human intervention in hand-feeding the stronger puppies is necessary to ensure that the runts get proper nourishment and attention from the mother. As they reach one month of age, puppies are gradually weaned and begin to eat solid food.</p>
